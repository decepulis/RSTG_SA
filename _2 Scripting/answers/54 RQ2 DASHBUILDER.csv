"Regarding individual chart filters (see example =>  !chartfilter.png|thumbnail! ) I think both ""master"" toolbar and individual chart filters can co-exist. A toolbar at the top of the dashboard screen could be implemented as another displayer component which allows for filtering on any of the properties of a given data set. Dashboard designer users can decide which approach to take. For toolbar, a toolbar filter component is dropped at the top of the page and filtering is disabled for every single chart.

"[~davidredhat] I see these filter tags used mostly with big data, faceted/complex filtering. I believe the use case there is that there is so much criteria (and objects) that you're filtering for you really need this kind of visual summary. But for individual chart filters I'm not sure the use case exists, perhaps a slightly more complex filter control would be enough, like a multi-select dropdown: http://dotansimha.github.io/angularjs-dropdown-multiselect/docs/#/main Wdyt? ",Liz Claytton,1,David Gutierrez, & Matthew Stevens
"There are some cases where individual chart filters control might make sense. See attached exampleB & exampleC. These are simple scenarios where we do not require a full featured filter toolbar as they are quite simple uses cases.  A filter toolbar is more suitable for full dashboard scenarios, see exampleA. Anyway, users can always choose whether to use individual chart filters or a global toolbar.  [~uxdlc] We do already have selector dropdowns for single column filtering, unlike the filter toolbar which is multi-column.   [~mstevens1]  1) As per each icon's tooltip: ""Export to CSV"", ""Export to Excel"", ""Show/hide columns"" 2) +1. The string is a hard coded literal 3) What are you trying to build?

"I seem to be losing the thread here a bit. A quick conversation might help. Some stray questions (none of which are directly related to the project Metrics page anymore)...  1) A filter at the top of the screen (a global filter) - does that data column need to be present in every chart on the screen? I can only globally filter by _time_, for example, if every chart has a time value. 2) When filtering one chart on the screen (local filter), should you also filter other charts that have the same data column? I filter one chart by ""David"" and the other charts with people update? 3) If answering yes to #2, should you then show the ""tags"" on the other charts to make it clear that the chart is filtered? 4) Have I gathered correctly that Dashbuilder uses NVD3? 5) Does the user get to choose whether the chart displays a legend? And, further, whether that legend is clickable / filters the chart? 6) Are all of these things customizable by the user anyway and my questions are moot?",Matthew Stevens,1,David Gutierrez,

"The following screenshot shows the toolbar implemented in RedHat's BPMS =>  !bpms_toolbar.png|thumbnail!   The first dropdown (""Id"") shows a set of predefined columns that support text based search. The rest of the dropdowns (""State"", ""Errors"", ""Name"" and ""Last update"") are extra filters for specific columns. They have been expanded in the toolbar to make it easier to operate with them as well as to provide custom filter controls depending on the column type. Notice, for example, the ""Last update"" column is an advanced control for selecting a date range.  In order to support the features above the following requirements must be also considered:  1.- The toolbar requires a list of columns to display in the generic column dropdown 2.- It also requires a sublist of the columns to be expanded in the toolbar  3.- Each expanded column may optionally have a divider element. This enables the concept of column groups in the expanded section  The main goal is to provide a generic toolbar able to support different toolbar configurations, including the one used in BPMS.  Regarding the discussion in previous comments about having individual chart filters. The best option is to remove them and rely only in either the toolbar component or the existing selectors components (dropdown, label set and slider). Whenever a filter is required in a dashboard, a filtering component needs to be dropped into the page. Charts will no longer provide filtering functionality. That will not only reduce the codebase but it will also keeps the filtering approach, Patternfly and the UXD on the same page.  [~uxdlc] [~mstevens1] wdyt?",David Gutierrez,,,

This is the old implementation =>  [^dashbuilder_filter_labels.mp4]   This is how it looks the new version =>  [^dashbuilder_filter_labels_new.mp4]   [~uxdlc] wdyt? :-),David Gutierrez,1,Liz Clayton,
"[~davidredhat] I sent my comments to a design related jira, next time will just post them here directly. The visual styling of the labels themselves looks more like PF, but some of the interaction aspects aren't aligned.  * For future iterations/enhancements: The PF filters are typically used in conjunction with a global [toolbar control|http://www.patternfly.org/pattern-library/forms-and-controls/toolbar/]. It's presented at the top of the screen (or content view) to indicate that everything on that screen is being filtered. The filter labels are shown there to help users to know at a glance which filters have been applied. I haven't seen an example where they are applied out of that context.   * Usability concerns with the current dashboard presentation are: _Because the labels are visually associated with one widget, an assumption will be made that the filters have only be applied to that widget.  _Users need to hunt around the screen to find the labels to figure out which filters have been applied, whereas in the PF toolbar design they are all presented in one location at the top of the screen.    To align the interaction with PF (in addition to the styling) could we look into the options for picking up the toolbar? Of it that can't be used for some reason, perhaps we could look into some alternative design solutions. Let me know what you think, thanks!  ",Liz Clayton,,,
"Initial implementation done. Preview video =>  [^dashbuilder_perspective_component.mp4]   As the video shows, there are issues with the layout rows. The logic behind the calculation of the row height seems not to be working very well.  [~ederign] any ideas?",David Gutierrez,,,

"This issue is a bit tricky.  The purpose of having a fixed with for a label set is mostly to expand its size (see  !selectorlabelswidth.png|thumbnail!).  Even in this example there might be cases where one item's name is still too large.  Also, it does not make sense to set a very small width since the item's name won't fit in the button.  So, what's the solution?  I think a good one could be as follows:   1.- Expand  If the total width is larger than the selector width then all the items shall be displayed without cuts and the remaining width should be split and added up evenly to every item. The total width is the sum of all items width whereas an item's width is calculated as a function based on its number of chars.   For example, if we have the following items: ""Red"", ""Green"" and ""Blue"", the total length is 12 chars and the total width 120px (provided we set 1 char=10px).  If, for instance, the selector width is set to 210 then the width of each item will be:  210-120 = 90px excess width => we split evenly 90/3 = 30px  => Red=3chars*10+30=60px, Green=5chars*10+30=80px, Blue=4chars*10+30=70px  As a result, every button is expanded 30px.  2.- Reduce  If the width set is smaller than the total width then we need to reduce each item so that they fit into the button reduced space. Given the example above and a selector width=90. then 90-120= -30px to reduce overall, -10px each item => Red=30-10=20px, Green=50-10=40px, Blue=40-10=30px. The buttons will show as ""Re"", ""Gree"", ""Blu"" with their corresponding tooltip showing the full name.  [~jhrcek] wdyt?",David Gutierrez,1,Jan Hrcek ,Missing two answerset
"[~uxdlc], [~jhrcek], the current implementation is ready to push.  I've implemented two alternatives:  1.- Item's menu attached to the type icon on the left =>  [^dashbuilder_navitem_actions2.mp4]  2.- Item's menu separated into a new icon on the right =>  [^dashbuilder_navitem_actions.mp4]   Option #2 makes more explicit the presence of a menu since the icon shows up only when the mouse is over the item.  Which do you like the most?  ",David Gutierrez,1,Jan Hrcek, & Liz Clayton
"[~jhrcek][~davidredhat] Cool! And I like Option #2 better as well. Couple of ideas: - I noticed that the cog icon turns blue on hover. For consistency, could we have all of the action icons (on the right) turn blue on hover?  - Except, wdyt of having the delete (trash can) icon turn red on hover to indicate that it’s a “destructive” action?

"Questions about this issue:  - The project already depends on resteasy (2.3.7). It is a dependency of Uberfire.
