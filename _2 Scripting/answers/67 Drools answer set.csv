"What should the URL look like in your opinion [~tirelli]? From a RESTful point of view, we're creating a new kie-container resource, so in theory it should be a PUT (create resource) on URL""/server/container/\{id\}"" that accepts a DMN file. However, that URL already exist. We could provide support for different request bodies in that operation (e.g. a `KieContainerResource` and a `DmnKieContainerResource`), but that could become a bit nasty ... We can also use a POST on something like ""/server/containers/\{id\}/resources"" and have that create a container resource under ""/server/containers/\{id\}"" (the reason I don't like a PUT in this case is because we create the resource (container) under a different URL than our request URL). The reason for the name ""resources"" (plural) is that we could provide multiple resources in the body (e.g. multiple DMN files). Second, apart from the DMN XML file (or files), do we also want to be able to post more information in the body (e.g. like additional information we pass in `KieContainerResource`)? And finally, should this be part of the DMN extension or KIE-Server Commons? The argument for DMN would be that otherwise we would expect Commons to have DMN knowledge. On the other hand, it's just deploying a KIE Containerner based on a resource file. The fact that that's a DMN model does not really matter (in theory this could be any resource file). Personally KIE-Server Commons makes most sense.",Duncan Doyle,1,Edson Tirelli,,,
"I don't think we should make this for jBPM as by nature it is stateful so once you create such resource and bounce the server it's gone while the data in db remains - kind of orphans. That in general applies to stateless/in memory stuff too, how would you deal with server restarts? Or is this intended for quick checks of resources? My vote is to include it in DMN extension or Drools if you would like to support other rule related resource types.",Maciej Swiderski,1,Edson Tirelli,Provide his opinion,,
I see two approaches to this: - if we consider it as demo only I would opt for having this to be as separate extension - so it can be deployed outside of the official distribution that way we avoid potential issues/bug reports that it won't survive server restarts - make it all the way down to survive the restarts by saving given kjar into maven repo locally and then simply register it as any other container. Not sure what is preferred as I don't know the origin of this request....,Maciej Swiderski,1,Duncan Doyle,Compare solutions,,

"Implementing AutoCloseable is only useful if you're planning to use the AutoCloseable resource in a try-with-resources block, but to be honest I don't think it will be common at all to use a KieSession in that way.

"Davide, thanks for the feedback. Regarding your comments: h5. Section 2 I considered that as well, but I think it is best to keep them as 2 separate pieces of syntax. The easiest way to see this is that a ""declare type"" statement is like declaring a class, while an ""event"" statement is like instantiating that class. While there can be only one ""declare type"" for each type, there can be multiple ""event"" statements to instantiate events of the same type based on different criteria. Just a dumb example to illustrate the idea: {code}declare type AccountDebit @role( event ) accountId : String ammount : BidDecimal end event AccountDebit as ATMTransaction( type == TransactionType.Withdraw, accountId : accountId, ammount : totalAmmount ) end event AccountDebit as InternetTransaction( type == TransactionType.TransferOut, accountId : accountId, ammount : totalAmmount ) end {code} h5. Section 4 * I agree that we don't want both a delimiter and the infix -> CE, but I am still not sure the infix will be enough for our needs. Will have to proceed to the design and implementation and revisit this issue when we get there. * The ""strict followed-by"" (=>) operator remains a possible implementation, but the more I think about it, the less I think it will be used, because in most of the use cases, there aren't any assurances that the events won't be intermixed in the streams coming into the system. Unless we have a compelling use case, I think this is a nice to have, but lower priority feature. I will add it to the spec anyway. Let me know if you know of any specific use case we should consider. * One can still use temporal operators to further constrain sequences of events: {code}$a : A() -> $b : B( this after[0,10s] $a ){code} I don't think it would be good to allow, at this point, further parameterization of the -> CE by itself. Basically, what the -> CE defines is a state machine/automaton, and that can be constrained as necessary by the patterns themselves with both temporal and non-temporal constraints. What do you think? * The problem of using the [] after the pattern type is that it become ambiguous with array types: A[*] ---> is this an array of A's with a typo or does it mean matching a repetition of A's? The ""exists[+] A()"" is feasible, just more verbose... do you think it would be worth writing a keyword there all the time? h5. Section 4.1 Yes, it is a step towards what you asked before... probably 80% of the way, but we would still need a few more things to get where you want... nevertheless, one feature that serves 2 purposes. h5. Section 5.5 The main difference is in semantics: event qualifiers only work with event sequencing. They are not Conditional Elements, like the ""not"" CE. That is the reason I can't decide between overloading the use of ""not"" or using a different keyword. In any case, all qualifiers are used in sequences of events, not in regular patterns. I actually need to check if there is any syntax ambiguity that I haven't identified yet.",Edson Tirelli,1,Davide Sottara ,Further explain requirements,,

"I see what you are trying to do, but I am not sure that such an attribute would be feasible, or even solve your problem. What happens if a rule inserts (and modifies, and retracts...) more than one object? And what happens if the same object is insert by more than one rule? Have you tried using the EQUALITY assertion behavior and/or the @propertyReactive annotation? The former considers equivalent (i.e. equals()) object to be the ""same"" and thus do not activate rules multiple times, regardless of the rule that generated the objects. The latter allows you to control how rules fire in case of updates. Best Davide",Davide Sottara ,1,Adar Dembo,,,
"I don't see the problem with modifications to multiple facts: you could condition on the NOT of the logical AND of all facts. Or the logical OR; I think both approaches are defensible. As for your second example, what's the issue with multiple rules asserting the same fact? In any case, I think the biggest challenge to implementation is that the rule consequence is a snippet of Java, and thus can do absolutely anything. For example, it could conditionally assert a fact. How do you modify the rule then? Also conditionally? Based on runtime input? It seems really challenging. The example that actually drove me to file this bug looks something like this: {noformat} rule ""1"" when accumulate (Foo($type : type, $value : value), $total : sum($value)) then insert(new Bar($type, $total)); end rule ""handle all Bars of type first"" when $bar : Bar(type == 'first', $total : total) ... then retract($bar); end rule ""handle all Bars of type second"" when $bar : Bar(type == 'second', $total : total) ... then retract($bar); end rule ""generic rule to handle all leftover Bars"" salience -1 // let custom Bar rules fire first when $bar : Bar($total : total) ... then retract($bar); end {noformat} The flow here is to convert the sum of all Foos (of a given type) into a Bar. Subsequently, there's a rule to handle each type of Bar, with a generic rule to handle Bars without a custom rule. To get that fallthrough behavior I need: # Salience -1 on the generic rule, so it fires last. # Retraction of each Bar as it's processed. However, the retraction causes the summation rule to reactivate, unless I add an explicit {{not Bar(type == $type)}} condition to the rule. Granted, in this case, I suppose the feature request mentioned here wouldn't work, because it'd add {{not Bar(type == $type, total == $total)}}, which would allow the rule to reactivate. For this example, I don't think equality-based assertion will solve my problem; fundamentally the retraction of a Bar causes us to reevaluate the accumulate rule. Likewise, I don't think @propertyReactive will help either; the issue here isn't with modifying a single property, but with removing an entire fact.",Adar Dembo,1,Davide Sottara ,Do not know yet,,

"In that example you're showing how to use try-with-resource with the StringWriter. That makes perfectly sense to me but it is not what I was asking. I was asking for a practical example using the KieSession because in my opinion in that case it is not that useful and using a try-with-resource is more verbose and cumbersome than simply adding a dispose. I cannot add this to drools 6.x because it has to stay Java 6 compatible, but I could do this on master (drools 7) that is Java 8 based. However I really don't see the usefulness in doing so.

"Hello, just a quick question, is it really required to keep the header-comment-license to the generated files of this archetype, please?

Similar analogy would apply to the other files generated by this artifact, as generated files are indeed meant to be modified to adapt to user's need, and the reason why I didn't put this header in the original PR. I can understand it is not a big deal to manually erase this header in all generated files where required, but if somebody is creating a lot of self-contained rule packages on a daily basis, it has an impact trust me =) Just open question, thank you, Ciao!",,,,Asked things not related to issue,Create a new issue?,

I have two question, please? # Do you agree with me reverting your change? # Did you notice the License file-headers are missing thanks to some automatic tool?

"Hi Mario, I have found why those tests fail with -Dfile.encoding=MS932. DrlParser.parse() uses resource.getInputStream() + resource.getEncoding() instead of resource.getReader() which commit#c3a90d5 fixed. resource.getEncoding() returns null and then it uses platform encoding. https://github.com/droolsjbpm/drools/blob/master/drools-compiler/src/main/java/org/drools/compiler/compiler/DrlParser.java#L150 If our direction is ""Use UTF-8 if encoding is not specified"" then, we should explicitly set ""UTF-8"" to 'encoding' in Resource class constructors. However, then, there is another concern. If users have Drools applications which depend on platform encoding (= expecting resources are decoded with platform encoding other than UTF-8), they will face that their applications are broken. To keep backward compatibility, one idea is a system property switch. Here I introduce ""drools.default.encoding.utf8.enabled"" system property (by default, it's true). If it's true, default encoding would be ""UTF-8"". If it's false, default encoding would be platform encoding (= ""file.encoding""). So if users want backward compatibility in Drools 6.2, they would need to set -Ddrools.default.encoding.utf8.enabled=false. This is the commit in my work branch. Now test cases run fine with both -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 and MS932. Could you review and let me know your thought? This commit fixes only ClassPathResource and ByteArrayResource. To make a pull request, I would need to fix more many classes. https://github.com/tkobayas/drools/commit/162fabbe0a614dbcf9783c1e10c1aa13b45de81f",Toshiya Kobayashi,,,N,,

"Edson, I 've been running into this issue a lot (with scary overflow or rounding errors such as 0.09 + 0.01 != 0.10). Something needs to be done. I see 3 ways: A) Stuff drools-planner with a kit functions, such as sumInteger, sumLong, sumDouble, ... I'd even recommend people in the manual not to ever use sum. B) Stuff drools-compiler itself with those functions. C) Fail-fast overloading of accumulate functions: Only the following sum functions are available: sum(Integer), sum(Double), sum(Long) so when ""the result type of the expression inside the function parenthesis"" is not Integer, Double or Long a compiler error is thrown. This presumes that mvel is mostly hard typed. If we wouldn't have to worry about backwards compatibility, I believe C) would be the best solution: Using the wrong type to sum leads to bugs, so we can't afford to guess and just go with double, because double only works for double and int: it does NOT work reliably for long and BigDecimal.
